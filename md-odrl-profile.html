        The Market Data Profile for ODRL provides all the additional vocabulary and semantics required both to express market data licenses in ODRL and to check compliance along the market data supply chain.

    <h2>Supply Chain Metamodel</h2>
    <p>
        The Market Data Profile for ODRL operates within the context of the market data supply chain. The benefits of its application accrue to its actors while its definitions of compliance classify their interactions. 
    </p><p>
        To unlock its potential we must situate the profile within a metamodel that describes these actors and the data resources they generate and trade. 
    </p><p>
        Their interactions are also frequently of direct relevance to the validity of market data Rules.

    <section id='Party Roles'>
        <h2>Party Roles</h2>
        <p>
            ODRL already defines the functions a Party plays in a rule. The roles here however describe the part a Party (or set of Parties) plays in the market data supply chain in the context of an Asset. 
        </p><p>
            Many Parties play different roles at different times. A large financial institution plays them all.
