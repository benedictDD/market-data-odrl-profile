# Rights Automation for Market Data Community Group

## Goal
The goal of this group is to develop and publish a profile of ODRL that allows the suppliers, vendors, and consumers of market data to translate their licenses into a machine-understood format that can support automated compliance testing and enforcement.

## Scope of Work
The work focuses on modelling the usage rights provided by market data licenses and their concomitant obligations as policies. 

Market data is mostly the pricing and trading data for financial instruments (and their associated indices) generated by trading venues. 

The group looks at how these policies progress along the market data supply chain by identifying the compliance and enforcement scenarios that the profile must support. A set of use cases and test cases provide our success criteria.
