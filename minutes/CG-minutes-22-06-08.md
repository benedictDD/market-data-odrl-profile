## TOPIC: Actions from Last Week

**Ben WS**
There were two actions from last month's meeting:
1. WFIC updates from JP Morgan and TMX.  Both have sent their apologies for today's meeting, so we'll bump that to our next meeting. 
2. I volunteered do some work on contract scope. I've summarised my understanding of our discussions over the last two meetings as a pattern which I'll present today.

First up in today's meeting is a discussion of white labelling. **Marya** and Rich have kindly offered to give us the CME perspective on this. So Marya, could you please give us an overview of what white labeling covers? And when when a exchange produces white labeling permissions, what are they seeking to achieve with them?

## TOPIC: White Labelling

**Marya**  
Yes, of course. A broad definition of white labeling is when a product or service is produced by a direct customer of an exchange (or a vendor) who then allows other companies to rebrand it as if were their own. Now to the more detailed cases.

Imagine there is an exchange customer that offers specific products or services. They have the technology, rules, methodologies, and data to govern these services or products. They're generally well established in the marketplace. 

Some of their customers may approach them and ask them to provide a platform that they can brand as their own. Or perhaps calculate a product on their behalf following their their rules and methodologies. 

The most common use case is index calculation. So you have these major players in the index field that create a host of branded indices that carry their name and follow their methodology. But they may also offer a custom service. 

That custom service can be broken down into a rebranded service (using the index provider's rules and methodology) or a white label service (using their customer's rules and methodology). In the later case, the index provider is acting as a calculation agent.

Now the way CME licenses these scenarios is that the IP owner (the provider of the rules and methodology) needs to hold the derived data license and be responsible for paying the derived data fees. 

So the most common use case we see is, as I said, are the custom services of index providers. But we also see it in the calculation of pre- and post-trade analytics when a third-party brands the service, tweaks it, and then deploys it as their own, and similarly in the physical energy and metals markets. 

So those are the three most common use cases we see for white labeling that requires derived data licensing.


**Ben WS**  
Let me try and play this back. In one use case, you might have a bank that wants to use a particular algorithm to create an index. They may use a calculation agent to create that index and distribute it to their customers. 


**Marya**  
Yes, the reason they call it white labeling is because you're not using the brand of the index provider. You're basically allowing the bank to use your technology and platform but brand it as their own.


**Ben WS**  
Okay. Can you clarify the other two?


**Marya**  
Say you design analytics but you don't have the distribution platform (and possibly the analytics platform) to reach certain customer segments. So you enter into a white label agreement with a vendor that allows distribution on their platform. But you're managing the permissioning - you're still acting as the commercial agent. So, while you are using a vendor platform, you still own your customer base.


**Mark B** 
Marya, am I right to say that the difference between these two use cases is that in the first case the licensee is not the party receiving and acting upon the data - that's the calculation agent.  And in option two, the licensee is the analytics provider.


**Marya**  
The derived data licensing simply follows the IP - who owns the intellectual property and acts as the commercial agent.


**Ben WS**  
Could you just define "commercial agent" here. Is this a key concept?


**Marya**  
The key reason to white label a product is because you simply don't have the technology to deliver it. You have that product you believe in, that you want to put out in the marketplace and monetise. But to do so, you must leverage someone else's technology and capabilities.


**Ben WS**  
So to clarify, let's say I am an analytics startup and I negotiate with a vendor to get access to their terminal estate. Is this a white label arrangement or am I just distributing through the vendor?


**Marya**  
So it really depends on what the agreement is between the vendor and me.

If it's just some analytics that goes to all the vendor's customers on the vendor's paper, the no, that's not a white label arrangement. That's just redistribution.

But imagine I'm a small analytics company, like you said, and I create these awesome analytics tools. I want them to be mine but I reach out to a vendor and ask to leverage their terminal estate for a fee. The vendor then permissions and displays my data but only for customers on my paper in a white label arragement.


**Ben WS**  
Okay, thank you. I think I've got the second one. What is the third one?


**Marya**  
So the third one is purely in the physical energy and metals world.


**Ben WS**  
Some final questions. My white-labelled analytics can then be used for either display or non-display use cases? 


**Marya** 
Correct.


**Mark B** 
**Marya**, maybe just can you talk about some typical commercials for white labeling. And in particular, are there any commercial arrangements that are unique to white labeling?


**Marya**  
Prior to my time at CME, I worked at a large index provider. I was on the branded side but that also supports the custom side. If it was our IP, we charged accordingly, usually with fixed fees. But if it was client IP, then we charged for technology and manpower costs plus a small markup.

Now from CMEs perspective, we are agnostic as to whether the final product or service is a branded product or a white label service.

If you're disseminating, marketing, and branding an index, then we charge the same whether you're calculating it or using a third-party calculation agent. The only difference is that we ask you to let us know who your calculation agent is. 


**Rosalind**
Does the calculation agent have to license with the exchange? Or is that license held, for example, by the bank who need only notify the CME of the calc agent.


**Marya**  
So technically, the calculation agent does not need a derived data license in order to calculate an index on behalf of a third-party. They are covered under the IP owner's license as soon as they're assigned as the calculation agent. 

The caveat is that there might be an access license. Does the IP owner just feed the data into the calculation agent and then receive the derived data back? Or does the calculation agent need access to the data to do the service? So maybe an access license [the Information License Agreement], but not a derived data license.
