## Minutes of the Last Meeting
The minutes of the last meeting were agreed.

## Types of Data
Michelle presented a taxonomy of data categories. https://github.com/w3c/market-data-odrl-profile/blob/gh-pages/DataCatagories.csv

Emily pointed out that the taxonomy had some implicit dimensions that might be useful to make explicit. She suggested a delivery dimension: desktop, pubs & subs, streaming, and non-streaming feeds.

**ACTION: Ben to amend the taxonomy to define two facets: a data type facet and a delivery type facet.**

Michelle suggested the term "web delivery" be added to the delivery type taxonomy, which could include web-scraping.

## Prioritising License Types
Together the CG then prioritised three of the data categories for further analysis of their controlling licenses: Indices, Reference data, and commodities data in the context of Research & Analytics.

**ACTION: Could members of the CG please provide examples of the licensing constructs that appear in these types of licenses. For example, the content segmentation of Indices into values, constituents, and weightings.**

## New Terms
The CG then discussed the term "Download" as a candidate for the standard. Ben wondered if it differed significantly from the existing term "Store". What additional work was it doing? The CG could determine none, so the term was rejected.

Mark D asked about the fate of such common but un-used terms. The CG committed to maintaining a list of synonyms.

Caspar updated the CG on the business process diagrams he's creating to document the compliance decisions required to create structured products.

He suggested that similar work on documenting the compliance decisions around index creation indicated that we might need terms to describe the action of decompiling, which could then be used in the context of a prohibition. He also noted that the standard might need to support the concept on non-competing products.

Ben highlighted the usefulness of these diagrams in testing the expressiveness of the the standard. Could it be used to describe each of the documented decision points? These analyses are driving and validating the writing of the pattern book.

## Reporting Model
Mark B offered to present the model DataBP uses to facilitate reporting at the CG's next meeting. The CG gratefully accepted.

## Communications
The CG discussed its communications with the wider industry. It agreed to publish a LinkedIn posting following each meeting.

**ACTION Ben volunteered to write the first post.**
