### Agenda

We won't get much chance to go into detail with an agenda this long, but I think it will help us set a direction for the coming year.

1. WIFIC: what should we be aiming to present in a year?
- Automated rights management for internal/Cloud data market places?

2. Best Practices Document: Common Modelling Patterns
For example, how should we express, in ODRL:
- Payment duties
- Consent duties
- The distribution of derived data
- Control over the use of distributed data
... and on

3. What types of Policies do we need from a supply-chain perspective?
- Requests - from data consumers to data providers
- Offers - from data providers to data consumers
- Agreements - between consumers and providers
- Sets - template policies

4. Reference Architecture
- What is a reference architecture?
- What's in? That which supports interoperability?
- Agents and orchestration
- XACML architecture
- Key components

5. Relationship with ODRL Central:
- ODRL Formalism (inc. Deontic State, Prohibitions)
- Temporal
