# Duty: Request

**Definition: The Debtor makes the Creditor aware of a desired state of the world (defined by the action scope).**

In this case, the Debtor is a Consumer of data; the Creditor is the Originator.

Example: A user of DBAG data would like a Service Facilitator to assist them in processing the data internally. Before they are allowed to do so, they must *request* permission. In some cases, simply making the request is enough to satisfy the terms of the agreement. But, as we'll see in the next duty, sometimes it's only the beginning of the process.

# Duty: Notify

**Definition: The Debtor makes the Creditor aware of a relevant change in the state of the world (defined by the action scope).**

Sometimes, the Debtor is the Originator who is informing the Consumer (the Creditor) of something, often that a request has been granted.

Example: A user of DBAG data has previously requested that they be allowed to use a Service Facilitator in a certain scenario. Before they can do so, DBAG must *notify* them that their request has been granted.

Other times, the Debtor is a Redistributor or Consumer of data, *notifying* the Originator that they've begun using a particular data product or that they've begun distributing data to a new third party.

Example: Refinitiv is required to tell DBAG before distributing uncontrolled data to a new end user. There are no additional obligations (e.g. no need to wait or approval) but the must inform the exchange before entitling their new client.
