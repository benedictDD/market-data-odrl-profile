# August 5th, 2020: Topics for Discussion

Agenda: 

* Finalize definitions of Notify and Report
* Temporal Aspects of Policy Lifecycle

## Duties: Notify and Request

**Notify:** The debtor makes the creditor aware of a relevant change in the state of the world (defined by the action scope) usually on a one-off basis.

**Request:** The debtor provides a report to the creditor on a relevant state of the world (defined by the action scope) usually on a regular basis.

*Is frequency the right differentiator between these two?*
