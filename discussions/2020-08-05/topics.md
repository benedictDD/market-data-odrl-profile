# August 5th, 2020: Topics for Discussion

Agenda: 

* Finalize definitions of Notify and Report
* Begin discussion of Temporal Aspects of Policy Lifecycle

## Duties: Notify and Report

**Notify:** The debtor makes the creditor aware of a relevant change in the state of the world (defined by the action scope) usually on a one-off basis.

**Report:** The debtor provides a report to the creditor on a relevant state of the world (defined by the action scope) usually on a regular basis.

*"Usually on a one-off basis:" Is frequency the right differentiator between these two?*

Possibilitites:

* Scheduled (Report) vs. Unscheduled (Notify)
* Structured (Report) vs. Unstructured (Notify)
* Has Unit of Count (Report) vs. No Unit of Count (Notify)
* Multi-line (Report) vs. Single-Line (Notify)
* Others?

## Temporal Aspects of Policy Lifecycle

Why is it important to support temporal aspects?

* **Support audits:** The model must support an account of history that both the data Provider and the data Consumer can agree upon through the audit process.

* **Ensure compliance as policies update:** The model must continue to support provably-correct compliance decisions in the present as policies change and update over time.

* **Enable forecasting:** The model must support an account of the future so actors in the supply chain can predict their capabilities and costs as and when updates are published.



## Time to Vote!

Hopefully we decided on how to define Notify and Report!
