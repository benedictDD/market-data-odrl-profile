# Duty: Notify

**Definition: The Debtor makes the Creditor aware of a relevant change in the state of the world (defined by the action scope).**

Sometimes, the Debtor is the Originator who is informing the Consumer (the Creditor) of something, often that a request has been granted.

Example: A user of DBAG data has previously requested that they be allowed to use a Service Facilitator in a certain scenario. Before they can do so, DBAG must *notify* them that their request has been granted.

Other times, the Debtor is a Redistributor or Consumer of data, *notifying* the Originator that they've begun using a particular data product or that they've begun distributing data to a new third party.

Example: Refinitiv is required to tell DBAG before distributing uncontrolled data to a new end user. There are no additional obligations (e.g. no need to wait or approval) but the must inform the exchange before entitling their new client.
