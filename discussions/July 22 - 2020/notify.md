# Duty: Notify

**Definition: The Debtor makes the Creditor aware of a relevant change in the state of the world (defined by the action scope).**

In this case, the Debtor is the Originator who is informing the Consumer (the Creditor) of something, often that a request has been granted.

Example: A user of DBAG data has requested that they be allowed to use a Service Facilitator in a certain scenario. Before they can do so, DBAG must *notify* them that their request has been granted.
