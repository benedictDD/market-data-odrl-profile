# Duty: Request

**Definition: The Debtor makes the Creditor aware of a desired state of the world (defined by the action scope).**

In this case, the Debtor is a Consumer of data; the Creditor is the Originator.

Example: A user of DBAG data would like a Service Facilitator to assist them in processing the data internally. Before they are allowed to do so, they must *request* permission. In some cases, simply making the request is enough to satisfy the terms of the agreement. But, as we'll see in the next duty, sometimes it's only the beginning of the process.

Read more about it on the [Notification, Request, and Consent Duties](/w3c/market-data-odrl-profile/issues/6) issues page.
