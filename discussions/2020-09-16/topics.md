* Meeting Cadence 
* Report on the FISD Exchange Forum

## Deliverables and Short-term Timeline

In October 2019, the precursor to the community group presented proof of concept applications at WFIC. The scope of the POC was limited to a single type of non-display license.

Now that we're farther along in building out our implementation of ODRL, what form should the next deliverable take, and when can we target its delivery? Some possibilities:

* Codified specification of a more fully-defined language
* Codified set of use cases; business challenges we're trying to solve
* Codified set of test cases; usage queries we want the language to support
* Application code producing and consuming ODRL for these test cases

Are there others? Can we make this list more specific in its short-term goals?

Finally, is December 2020 the right target, and what specifically can we accomplish by that time?

## Work Accomplished, Work To Do

We have made progress in applying the ODRL language to our industry, fleshing out Roles, Resources, Actions, and Duties:

* [Voting History](https://github.com/w3c/market-data-odrl-profile/blob/gh-pages/Vote.md)

We have started collecting use cases, but can focus more on this aspect in the weeks ahead: [Test Cases](https://github.com/w3c/market-data-odrl-profile/blob/gh-pages/Test-Cases.md)

What, specifically, should we seek to accomplish for the next deliverable?

## Meeting Cadence

Would it improve our throughput to set a standing breakout session in off-weeks? This breakout session could be voluntary and more technical focused, leaving the larger group to tackle building out use cases, and the ways we'll prove our ability to test those cases, in the main session.

For example, we could move the dreaded "Creditor/Debtor" controversy to a breakout session.
