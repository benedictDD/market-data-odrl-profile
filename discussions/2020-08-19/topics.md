## Duties: Notify and Report

###Editor's Recomendation###: These definitions of Notify and Report draw their distinction between the notification of an *event* and the reporting of a *state of affairs*:

**Notify:** The debtor makes the creditor aware of a relevant event (defined by the action scope).

**Report:** The debtor provides a report to the creditor on a relevant and on-going state of affairs (defined by the action scope).

###Other attempts###

*Previous suggestion*:

**Notify**: The debtor makes the creditor aware of a relevant change in the state of the world (defined by the action scope).

**Report**: The debtor provides a report to the creditor on a relevant state of the world (defined by the action scope).

*Frequency*:

**Notify**: The debtor makes the creditor aware of a relevant change in the state of the world, usually done once. (defined by the action scope).

**Report**: The debtor provides a report to the creditor on a relevant state of the world, often on a regularly defined schedule. (defined by the action scope).

*Structure*:

**Notify**: The debtor makes the creditor aware of a relevant change in the state of the world, usually in an unstructured manner. (defined by the action scope).

**Report**: The debtor provides a report to the creditor on a relevant state of the world, usually in a format defined by the creditor. (defined by the action scope).

*Unit of Count*:

**Notify**: The debtor makes the creditor aware of a relevant change in the state of the world, usually with no specified unit of count. (defined by the action scope).

**Report**: The debtor provides a report to the creditor on a relevant state of the world, usually by counting items of a partular unit. (defined by the action scope).

*Sender/Receiver*:

**Notify**: The debtor (most often the provider) makes the creditor aware of a relevant change in the state of the world. (defined by the action scope).

**Report**: The debtor (most often the consumer) provides a report to the creditor on a relevant state of the world. (defined by the action scope).

##New Terms for "Creditor and "Debtor"

A Duty has two related parties: The party requiring the Duty and the party responsible for permforming the Duty. We've been calling these parties the Creditor and the Debtor, but would like to find a clearer pair of terms. Some suggestions:

| Creditor | Debtor |
|---|---|
| Actor  | Target  |
| Giver  | Receiver |
| Subject  | Object  | 
| Obligatee | Obligator  |
| Licensor | Licensee  |
