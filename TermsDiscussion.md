## Purposes
Purposes are ofter used to constrain an action, e.g. for what purpose are you deriving the data?

We have plenty of values for this property (already)[https://w3c.github.io/market-data-odrl-profile/md-odrl-profile-draft.html#usage-0-9]. But several more have been suggested:
risk management , profit and loss calculations , valuation, reference pricing.

Are these all distinct? Do we have any duplications? And are there any others we should consider?

This seems quite common: internal business purposes. Is it simply a shorthand for all the others - or does it have a specific meaning that we need to capture?
