# Contract Vocabulary

We could model some of the non-assignment elements of a contract as another set of permissions. What might these permissions be?

1. To roll over the license
2. To respecify the product
3. To reprice the product
4. To terminate the contract
5. To terminate an element of the product.

Any others stand out? Here's a starting place:

## Relicensing
Actor:      Licensor

Action:     Relicense

Target:     The contract

Duty:       Notify the licensee

Remedy:     Licensee can object

## Respecifying
Actor:      Licensor

Action:     Respecify

Target:     The product

Duty:       Notify the licensee

Remedy:     Licensee can cancel the license

## Reprice
Actor:      Licensor

Action:     Reprice

Target:     The product

Duty:       Notify the licensee

Remedy:     Licensee can cancel the license

## Terminate the Contract
Actor:      Licensor or Licensee

Action:     Terminate

Target:     The contract

Duty:       Notify the licensee/licensor

There will likely also be a basis constraint here - "cause" will likely not allow for notice to be given.

## Terminate an Element of the Product
Actor:      Licensor

Action:     Terminate

Target:     Element of the product

Duty:       Notify the licensee/licensor

Does it make sense to model these contractual relations as permissions? If so, are we capturing the key ones?
