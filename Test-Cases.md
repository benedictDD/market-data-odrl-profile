# Test Cases
One of the key objectives of the Rights Automation for Market Data Community Group is to provide a standard, machine readable description of market data licenses so that applications can decide, on the basis of those descriptions, whether a usage is allowed or not.

The test cases listed here are the kinds of questions asked day-in, day-out of market data professionals. They are also our way of measuring progress towards that objective. Can we turn these questions into queries? Do we get the right answers?

## Redistribution of Data
Sending data externally (attributes vary across all vendors and/or may require additional licenses which incur costs)

#### RoD-1
Can I send a small amount of data to a client, in support of a transaction, on a one-off basis?<br>

#### RoD-2

#### RoD-3
Can I send some data, in a chart format, in a research report to 400 clients, on a monthly basis?<br>
*(Submitted by Michelle Roberts)*

#### RoD-4

*(Submitted by Richard Mundell)*

#### RoD-5

## Non-display Use
For example, use of real-time data in a new application

#### NDU-1
Can I use real-time data in a new internal application, which will not display the data to any end users?<br>
*(Submitted by Michelle Roberts)*

#### NDU-2
Can I distribute the results from the new application to other users internally?
<br>*(Submitted by Michelle Roberts)*

#### NDU-3
Can I distribute the results from the new application to external users at the end of each day?<br>
*(Submitted by Michelle Roberts)*

## Derived Data
Data being derived from varying sources, including for creation of Indices

#### DD-1
Can I create derived data from one vendor/exchange, using end of day data, for internal use?
<br>*(Submitted by Michelle Roberts)*

#### DD-2
Can I create derived data, using delayed data, from 5 different vendors/exchanges, for internal use?<br>

#### DD-3
Can I create derived data, in the form of an index, using EOD data, from 5 different vendors/exchanges, and send the result to a client?<br>
*(Submitted by Michelle Roberts)*

#### DD-4
Can I create a spreadsheet combining two vendors data to create derived data
*(Submitted by Richard Mundell)*

#### DD-5
I’m creating a spreadsheet combining two vendors data to create derived data – am I allowed to share this with clients?
