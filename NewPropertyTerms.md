# New Property Terms

## Derived Data
We do not explicitly make the distinction between raw and derived data in ODRL. We presently borrow from the semantics of the [PROV ontology](https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-o/) for terms like [prov:wasDerivedFrom](https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-o/#wasDerivedFrom).

But we do need to be clear whether we can treat the terms **New Original Works**, **Second Generation Products**, **Originally Computed Figures**, and **Original Created Works** as meaning the same.

Can we simply achieve this with our `ipOwner` property?
